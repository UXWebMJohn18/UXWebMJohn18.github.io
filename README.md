My github account is a free account connected to my student email.

The repository I created is housed on the github website and cloned onto my hard drive.

The steps I took involved downloading GitHub to my computer and installing it. Once I installed it, I logged into my account and clicked on the repository I had already made on the web version. Upon clicking it, it gave me the option to clone it to my computer. Which I did and cloned it in a new file I created on my external SSD.
